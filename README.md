Idea: 
We want to make an android app which will help a parent see the location of their children using Google Maps. There will be two versions of the app, one for the parent and the other for the child. In the child app there will be an option of inserting a unique code of the parent so that the app knows whose children they are and show locations accordingly.

Problem: 
We are trying to solve a problem of parents worrying where their children are when they aren’t picking up a call, when someone is kidnapped and can also be used if the phone is stolen or lost.

Solution: 
Our application will show the location of the person at any given moment as long as the location system is on, thus, giving access to parents to know where their children are.

Features: 
1.	Real Time Tracking:
Most GPS Tracking devices are enabled with real-time monitoring. Location of the vehicles is tracked on the map as it moves from point to point. The GPS location of your vehicle is displayed on a map. The current state of child, like moving or idle is shown using map markers.

2.	Registration: 
The user will have to register first. There will be two kinds of registration. One is parent and another is the child. The parent can see the location of their child’s phone. The child type can also track their parent’s phone. 

3.	History:
User can track all the places went by the child graphically on the map.

Technology:
Androids studio will be used for making the application. Github will be used for uploading the parts of the application in one folder. Slack will be used for group discussion. And piazza will be used for class discussion.
 
Monetization: 
We will have a monthly subscription for the parent who will track their child. If they want to track more than one child, they have to pay extra in the monthly subscription per child they want to add. 
There will be in app advertisements such as ad banners which will constantly be there at the bottom of the screen. There will be video ads which they can see to earn points and then redeem the points to pay for the subscription of increasing the number of children. The number of videos will be set in such a way that the total revenue from the videos will be a bit higher than what they would have paid for the subscription.
Payment methods will be Credit Card system where they will add they will credit card number and every month from the day they start, a notification will come whether they want to pay for another month or not.
The customer will also be able to pay with Bkash and Ucash since these are very common in Bangladesh.
